# Asteroids
## One Game A Month
---

This is my first game for [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/), it is a simple version of Asteroids that I built towards the end of last year, you can find the game [here](http://garfty.com/onegameamonth/january/asteroids/). It uses self made artwork, with free royalty free music from. The game is built on the Flash Platform utilising Starling and an Component based entity system.

The Game features four difficulty levels, with four levels where the number of asteroids in each level.

The component based entity system has not been included with this source code and is a seperate compiled library, if you are interested in Eneity Systems, I would recommend looking as Richard Lord's [Ash framework](http://www.ashframework.org/).
